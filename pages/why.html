                    Our home contains toxins in a number of different forms. Numerous items in our daily life expose us to chemicals that are bad for our health, including perfumes, cleaning supplies, cosmetics, and plastic water bottles. Since avoiding exposure to hazardous substances is an important aspect of health and wellbeing that goes beyond food and exercise, it is crucial to be aware of these toxins and take action to get rid of them whenever possible. While we may restrict some of your exposure to toxins, we cannot completely stop it.<br>
                    Non-Biodegradable products are products that can’t be broken down naturally into simpler organic or inorganic matter. These include many household products we use daily such as plastic bottles, glass bottles, styro foam, aluminum cans, tin cans, aluminum foil, plastic straws, ziploc bags, plastic bags, nylon, leather shoes, disposable diapers, sanitary pads, rubber shoes, batteries, ink cartridges, scrap metal, tires and more. Non-biodegradable products remain on our planet for many years before they begin to decompose with some taking between 10 – 1000 years.

                    <li class="dangers">These toxins are carcinogenic that can cause severe harm to the metabolism of living organisms after they are absorbed. Their consumption can even prove to be fatal for a large number of species including Homo sapiens.

                    <li class="dangers">Constant exposure of plastics to heat melts those resulting in the emission of gasses into the atmosphere in a process known as outgassing. Incinerating plastic causes toxic fumes to be released into the atmosphere. Inhaling this polluted air causes different types of diseases like tuberculosis and other forms of respiratory tract infections.

                        Non-eco-friendly packaging materials have toxins such as petroleum-based and bisphenol A (BPA) that can contaminate food and water. Needless to say, this is harmful to human health. They are also dangerous to marine life. Solid waste materials harm marine life as well when they pollute the water
